# Why I'm Going Local-First for My Next App

The cloud is great until it isn't. Here's why my next project prioritizes local-first architecture.

## What is Local-First?

Local-first means your data lives on your device first, syncing to the cloud as a secondary concern.

```typescript
// Data available instantly, syncs in background
const notes = await localDB.notes.getAll();
syncEngine.push(notes); // Non-blocking
```

## The Benefits

1. **Instant Performance** - No network latency for reads
2. **Offline Capable** - Works everywhere, always
3. **Privacy by Default** - Your data stays yours
4. **Resilience** - Server goes down? You're fine.

## The Stack I'm Using

- **SQLite** via better-sqlite3 for local storage
- **CRDT** libraries for conflict resolution
- **libp2p** for peer-to-peer sync

## Trade-offs

It's not all roses:

- More complex conflict resolution
- Larger client bundles
- State management complexity

But for many apps, the trade-offs are worth it.

## The Project

I'm building a personal knowledge base that works offline and syncs across devices. Stay tuned for updates.
