# Building Fast Web Apps with Rust and WebAssembly

JavaScript has served us well, but sometimes you need more performance. That's where Rust and WebAssembly come in.

## Why Rust for WebAssembly?

Rust compiles to incredibly efficient WASM. No garbage collector means predictable performance.

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn fibonacci(n: u32) -> u32 {
    match n {
        0 => 0,
        1 => 1,
        _ => fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
    }
}
```

## The Setup

Getting started is straightforward:

1. Install `wasm-pack`
2. Create a new lib with `cargo new --lib`
3. Add the wasm-bindgen dependency
4. Build with `wasm-pack build`

## Performance Results

In my benchmarks, the WASM version was 40x faster for compute-heavy tasks. The trade-off is increased bundle size and complexity.

## When to Use It

- Image/video processing
- Physics simulations
- Cryptographic operations
- Complex data transformations

Not everything needs WASM. Profile first, optimize second.
