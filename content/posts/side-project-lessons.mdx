# What 10 Failed Side Projects Taught Me

Over the past decade, I've started and abandoned more side projects than I can count. Here's what I learned.

## The Graveyard

- A social network for book clubs (2015)
- An AI-powered meal planner (2017)
- A "Tinder for hiking buddies" app (2018)
- A Chrome extension for productivity (2019)
- ... and many more

## The Lessons

### 1. Ship Early, Learn Fast

Every project that failed taught me something. The ones I never shipped taught me nothing.

### 2. Solve Your Own Problems

My only "successful" side project solves a problem I personally have every day.

### 3. Technology Doesn't Matter

I spent months choosing between frameworks when I should have been talking to users.

> "The best time to ship was yesterday. The second best time is now."

### 4. Perfect is the Enemy of Done

My abandoned projects all have one thing in common: I was waiting for them to be "ready."

## Moving Forward

I'm now working on something new. This time, I shipped an MVP in one weekend. Users are already giving feedback.

That's progress.
