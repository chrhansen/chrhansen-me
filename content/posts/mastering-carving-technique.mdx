# Mastering the Art of Carving

As a software engineer, I've always approached problems systematically. When I decided to improve my carving technique, I applied the same analytical mindset.

## The Physics of the Turn

The key insight was understanding edge angle geometry. The relationship between edge angle theta and turn radius R can be approximated by:

```
R = L / tan(theta)
```

Where L is the sidecut radius of your ski.

## Breaking Down the Movement

1. **Initiation** - Weight transfer begins before the fall line
2. **Apex** - Maximum edge angle, minimum radius
3. **Completion** - Pressure release and transition setup

## What Changed My Skiing

The breakthrough came when I stopped thinking about turning and started thinking about tilting. Let the ski's geometry do the work.

> "The best turns happen when you get out of your own way." - Some instructor, probably

Next season, I'm focusing on:
- Earlier weight transfer
- More aggressive angulation
- Quieter upper body

See you on the slopes.
